# Dhaval Shah's Python Learning Journey

## Introduction
My name is Dhaval Shah, and I recently started learning Python. I am committed to improving my coding skills and have decided to challenge myself by solving at least 5 questions daily. I will be posting my solutions on my Github repository every day.

## Daily Progress
I will update my Github repository every day with the solutions to the 5 questions I have solved. You can check out my progress on my [Github repository](https://github.com/sdhaval97/Daily-Python).

## Resources
I am using [w3resource.com](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/python-basic-exercises.php) to find the questions I will be solving. I have also been using Mosh's YouTube videos to help me learn Python.

## Goals
My goal is to become proficient in Python and be able to tackle more complex programming challenges. By solving 5 questions daily, I hope to develop my problem-solving skills and gain a deeper understanding of Python's syntax and functionality.

## Conclusion
I am excited about this learning journey and look forward to sharing my progress with others. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please feel free to reach out to me via my Github repository.
